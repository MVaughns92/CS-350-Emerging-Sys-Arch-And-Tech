# CS-350-Emerging-Sys-Arch-And-Tech

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

The goal of this project was to develop a system for a simple thermostat that would signify when a current ambient temperature didn't meet the specified temperature depending on the setting (cool vs heat). The problem to be solved was a lack of ability to see room temperature and how it related to the goal temperature.

What did you do particularly well?

I feel I succeeded in keeping my code neat and organized. Additionally, once I was confident in it, building the breadboard to the specific setup needed for all items to run properly.

Where could you improve?

I feel I could improve by providing better inline comments, instead of using the ones provided in the code that was already included. 

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?

I am honestly in love with the Raspberry Pi and will be using it after this course. It is a very versatile machine with practically endless options. It will prove to be a useful item in my household. Additionally, the knowledge of Secure Shell will be something I anticipate revisiting. 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?

Debugging and troubleshooting in hardware. I did have experience with it in the past, mostly very small devices (desktop fans and old handheld gaming systems), however I did not attempt anything requiring adjusting wires. The biggest benefit, especially with the GPIO cable and board was showing what the pins corresponded to.

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I included best coding practices in the project, keeping the code tidy and using comments (even if I felt they could be more detailed). Method and variable naming were set up to be in line with pre-established items, instead of creating new methods/variables.
